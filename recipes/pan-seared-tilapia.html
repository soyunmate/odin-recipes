      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>
          1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste (Optional)
        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste (Optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
          Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the flour
          to coat and shake off any excess.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia
          fillets in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until fish flakes
          easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brush the melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute
          before removing from the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drizzle fillets with lemon juice and garnish with parsley and thyme.
        </li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy</li>
      </ol>
